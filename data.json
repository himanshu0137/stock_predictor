When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together.As you can see below, at the end of March 2019, Tata Motors had \u20b91.10t of debt, up from \u20b9933.7b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. On the flip side, it has \u20b9414.8b in cash leading to net debt of about \u20b9689.4b.We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Tata Motors had liabilities of \u20b91.45t falling due within a year, and liabilities of \u20b91.01t due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of \u20b9414.8b and \u20b9258.5b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by \u20b91.79t.This deficit casts a shadow over the \u20b9461.0b company, like a colossus towering over mere mortals. So we'd watch its balance sheet closely, without a doubt After all, Tata Motors would likely require a major re-capitalisation if it had to pay its creditors today.In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).While Tata Motors's debt to EBITDA ratio (4.5) suggests that it uses debt fairly modestly, its interest cover is very weak, at 0.68. It seems that the business incurs large depreciation and amortisation charges, so maybe its debt load is heavier than it would first appear, since EBITDA is arguably a generous measure of earnings. So shareholders should probably be aware that interest expenses appear to have really impacted the business lately. Even worse, Tata Motors saw its EBIT tank 75% over the last 12 months. If earnings keep going like that over the long term, it has a snowball's chance in hell of paying off that debt. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Tata Motors's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. During the last three years, Tata Motors burned a lot of cash. While investors are no doubt expecting a reversal of that situation in due course, it clearly does mean its use of debt is more risky.To be frank both Tata Motors's EBIT growth rate and its track record of staying on top of its total liabilities make us rather uncomfortable with its debt levels. And furthermore, its interest cover also fails to instill confidence. It looks to us like Tata Motors carries a significant balance sheet burden. If you play with fire you risk getting burnt, so we'd probably give this stock a wide berth. Even though Tata Motors lost money on the bottom line, its positive EBIT suggests the business itself has potential. So you might want to check outAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

It has a market capitalization of \u20b9527b. Normally institutions would own a significant portion of a company this size. Taking a look at our data on the ownership groups (below), it's seems that institutions are noticeable on the share registry. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups, to learn more about TATAMOTORS.Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Tata Motors already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own 46% of the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone, since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Tata Motors's earnings history, below. Of course, the future is what really matters.We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Tata Motors. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Tata Motors Limited in their own names. We do note, however, it is possible insiders have an indirect interest through a private company or other corporate structure. It is a pretty big company, so it would be possible for board members to own a meaningful interest in the company, without owning much of a proportional interest. In this case, they own around \u20b95.0m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably, recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can With a 19% ownership, the general public have some degree of sway over TATAMOTORS. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.We can see that Private Companies own 32%, of the shares on issue. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research.While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this ", "index": 0.19750646840148697}, {"time": "2019-05-21", "title": "Tata Motors shares hit by Jaguar Land Rover woes, weak home market", "text": "By Ismail Shakil and Chris ThomasMUMBAI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Tata Motors Ltd gave an uninspiring outlook for its luxury brand Jaguar Land Rover and forecast weak demand in the Indian automaker's home market, sending its shares 6% lower on Tuesday.Mumbai-based Tata Motors, which reported quarterly earnings results after markets closed on Monday, has been struggling with its JLR arm for months due to a slump in China sales, while also dealing with a weak industry.Three months ago, Tata Motors announced plans to revamp JLR, after reporting the biggest loss of about $4 billion in Indian corporate history due to an impairment at JLR.\"It would be tough for JLR to come out of the negative free cash flow trajectory so easily in the near term, despite cutting planned capex,\" analysts at Ambit Insights said in a report.

The United States ranks seventh in EV sales as a percentage of overall sales, according to the International Energy Agency.Michelle Krebs, analyst at online marketplace Autotrader, expects EV sales to remain relatively modest until charging infrastructure, prices and battery performance improve.\"It's going to be a pretty long runway,\" Krebs said, adding EV sales may first rise dramatically in government and corporate fleets.In New York, industry executives said they face hurdles to selling EVs - persistently low fuel prices, lack of consumer education, lower residual values, higher upfront costs because of battery packs and consumer concerns about the availability of charging infrastructure.Nevertheless, automakers are showing sportier, more creative EVs than the original plug-in models that were mostly small cars.Hyundai Motor Co's luxury Genesis unit at the show showed an EV concept car, called the Mint, capable of an estimated 200 miles per full charge and fast recharging, while its Kia affiliate unveiled a concept EV crossover with butterfly wing doors called the HabaNiro.Daimler AG showed a new Mercedes-Benz SUV called the EQC Edition 1886 that will go on sale next year \"and then we have a whole lot of other electrics coming over the next couple of years,\" said Dietmar Exler, who heads Mercedes-Benz USA.Jaguar Land Rover began selling its electric Jaguar I-PACE, in late 2018 in the United States and is selling only about 200 a month. \"It will be a long, long time until we see mass adoption,\" said Joe Eberhardt, who heads the company's North American unit.The $70,000 I-Pace was named World Car of the Year this week at the New York show.There are nearly 300 million gasoline-powered vehicles on U.S. roads, Eberhardt said. \"Nobody is going to drive them into the ocean.\"He noted the economic advantages of EVs are slight at current gasoline prices. He suggested an I-PACE owner would on average save about $500 a year by using electricity rather than using fuel, but they will also save on maintenance costs.Germany's Volkswagen AG and its Audi unit are introducing a half-dozen new electric vehicles in the coming two years and have aggressive volume targets, aiming to have 20 to 30 percent of its sales as EVs by 2025.As part of VW's $25 billion \"dieselgate\" settlement, the German automaker agreed to add at least three additional electric vehicles, including an SUV, in California by 2020.Volkswagen U.S. chief Scott Keogh said the company, which showed off a concept ID Buggy EV, is investing in EVs not as a \"guilt play\" to address its prior diesel issues but to make money.Keogh says there will be a flurry of launches in the next three years but it will still be a few years beyond that. \"I think 2025 is where you're really going to see - is it taking hold?\" Keogh said.Audi said this week it plans to start delivering its new electric E-Tron SUV to U.S. consumers next month.

When earnings grow, the \u2018E\u2019 increases, over time. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. So while a stock may look expensive based on past earnings, it could be cheap based on future earnings.Most would be impressed by Tata Motors earnings growth of 21% in the last year. In contrast, EPS has decreased by 14%, annually, over 5 years.The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. If you look at the image below, you can see Tata Motors has a lower P/E than the average (15.7) in the auto industry classification.Tata Motors\u2019s P/E tells us that market participants think it will not fare as well as its peers in the same industry. Many investors like to buy stocks when the market is pessimistic about their prospects. You should delve deeper. I like to check It\u2019s important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. That means it doesn\u2019t take debt or cash into account. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).Tata Motors\u2019s net debt is considerable, at 105% of its market cap. If you want to compare its P/E ratio to other companies, you must keep in mind that these debt levels would usually warrant a relatively low P/E.Tata Motors\u2019s P/E is 7 which is below average (17) in the IN market. The company may have significant debt, but EPS growth was good last year. If the company can continue to grow earnings, then the current P/E may be unjustifiably low.Investors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about.

It is unlikely that we will further develop small diesel engines for smaller passenger cars,\" Armstrong said.BREXITArmstrong said any Ford layoffs and plant closures would be subject to negotiations with labour representatives, and such plans did not account for the possibility of a 'hard' exit by Britain from the European Union.\"If Brexit went in the wrong direction we would have to have another look, to mitigate that,\" Armstrong said.

In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have perpetual stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next five years. For this I used the consensus of the analysts covering the stock, as you can see below. I then discount this to its value today and sum up the total to get the present value of these cash flows.We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after the five years. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of the GDP. In this case I have used the 10-year government bond rate (7.7%). In the same way as with the 5-year \u2018growth\u2019 period, we discount this to today\u2019s value at a cost of equity of 15.5%.The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the cash flows, which in this case is \u20b9919b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. If the stock is an depositary receipt (represents a specified number of shares in a foreign corporation) or ADR then we use the equivalent number. The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don\u2019t have to agree with my inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. Because we are looking at Tata Motors as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighed average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation I\u2019ve used 15.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.065. This is derived from the Bottom-Up Beta method based on comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Whilst important, DCF calculation shouldn\u2019t be the only metric you look at when researching a company.
